    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cleaner Code`: Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy. With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "`Fewer Bugs`: There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "`Easier to Productionize`: It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "    \n",
    "`More Options for Model Validation`: You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous tutorial, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset.](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/ML-Bootcamp/blob/master/data/melb_data.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to practice sklearn pipelines on columns with low cardinality & missing values. You can find the details about how to do this in [this notebook](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/ML-Bootcamp/blob/master/Working%20with%20categorical%20data.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow the code in above notebook until line 80 to arrive at `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`. \n",
    "> I am going to take a shortcut to get there but i suggest you follow what you have learnt."
