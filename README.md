# ML-Bootcamp
## You will find here all the material for Week 1 of our ML boot camp. 

### 1. You will find pdf ebook (one of my favourates): Go through chapter 1 and 2 ( dont worry if you dont understand anything ) YOu will find how to install ANACONDA, you all must have this installed. 
Jupyter notebookes are where we would code and interact with python. We will be using this in all our classes.

### 2. How you use jupyter notebook -
    -a. Download the jupyter notebook from this repositary to your desktop ( jupyter notebooks have extention .ipjnb )
    -b. Click on start menu and type - Anaconda prompt
    -c. the command prompt navigate to your desktop, google how to use command prompt (google would be your best freind, i want to set you up with these skills early on)
    -d. once you have navigated to desktop (or where ever you have saved the jupyter notebook) type "jupyter notebook"
    -e. This should open jupyter notebook with the file you downloaded visible - click to open the file.

### if you are note able to do it - dont worry - we will do it together in the next session.
